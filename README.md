# Coding Standards

A collection of my coding standard modifications.

## Code Sniffer
The `src/CodingStandards/Sniffs` folder contains a collection of sniffers I've modified or created to suit my needs and preferences.  
The `src/CodingStandards/ruleset.xml` contains my custom [PHP Code Sniffer](!g) configuration.
